    <h2> Experience & Goals </h2>       
    <p>
        I currently work as an intern for the Utah Tech Alumni Association, where I assist with data restoration and help organize events. 
        Prior to pursuing tech, I spent six years in door-to-door sales, gaining experience as a manager and training officer across multiple companies. 
        hese experiences taught me leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills that I carry into my tech career today.
