    <h2> Hi! I'm Garrett May</h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently a software engineering student with a focus on <span style="color:#04d9ff;"> AI Devolopment</span>
        I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problelms and exploring the exciting possibilities in artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently work as an intern for the Utah Tech Alumni Association, where I assist with data restoration and help organize events. 
        Prior to pursuing tech, I spent six years in door-to-door sales, gaining experience as a manager and training officer across multiple companies. 
        hese experiences taught me leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills that I carry into my tech career today.
    </p>    
    <p>
         Outside of work and studies, I enjoy going to the gym, reading, and playing video games. 
         I also recently got married in October, which has been an exciting new chapter in my life.
