        <p>
            A lot of the other devoloper web pages I have seen tend to use a minamilst design, you dont see a lot of white back ground with text.
            They tend to have something creative about there page as well, either lots of pictures of themselves, or some sort of cool UI. I saw one
            where it was an infinate scroller but the information repeated every few scrolls. I also really love the darker aesthetics of a lot of the 
            sights I saw.
