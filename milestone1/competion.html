    <h4> What are some things your competion is doing that you like?</h4>
        <p>
            A lot of the other devoloper web pages I have seen tend to use a minamilst design, you dont see a lot of white back ground with text.
            They tend to have something creative about there page as well, either lots of pictures of themselves, or some sort of cool UI. I saw one
            where it was an infinate scroller but the information repeated every few scrolls. I also really love the darker aesthetics of a lot of the 
            sights I saw.
        </p>
    <h4> What is something your competion is doing you dont like?</h4>
        <p>
            I saw a lot of beige and white minimalist designs which I hate. It is way to boring and seems like something a infulencer mom would do, which
            is not the persona I want to give to future employers. I also saw some complicated UI designs that didnt seem like they got the point across 
            quickly and easily which is my goal.
        </p>
    <h4> What are some ideas of things you want to do different?</H4>
        <p>
            I want to make my page have a darker aesthitc with lots of blacks and browns, I want it to give sophisticated. 
            I also want to make sure that whatever creative ideas I implent into the webpage dont distract from my resume and portfolio of code and projects.
            So I want to keep it pretty simple with maybe one unique UI design.
