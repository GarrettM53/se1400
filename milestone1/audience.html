        <h4> What are some potential employers or school programs this site would target?</h4>
            <p> 
                Sandbox is a school sponsered program that would pair me with a marketing student to create a new app or idea and try and sell it for school credits.
                This webpage would help me show off my skills as a deveoloper and help me get into that program. There is also several companys around St. George that 
                I could get internships with. These include; TCN, Kronos, Vasion, and many more.
            </p>
        <h4> What general location are you targeting</h4> 
            <p>
                I am trying to stay in St. George UT, so I will be targeting companys and schools around that area.
